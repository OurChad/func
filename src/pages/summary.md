Hopefully you now have a better understanding of functional programming and it's benefits / drawbacks. For the craic and convenience we can summarise most of them here too.

### Pros
- Understanding and reason code logic should be easier for developers.
- Less error prone ðŸ¤ž as developers should have to write less code and not worry about weird side effects caused by mutable state.
- Code should be more easily testable (unit) as each function is pure.
- Code has **referential transparency** and should be more maintainable. Function implementations can be changed or replaced as long as their output remains the same.

### Cons
- Functional Programming has a learning curve to it and can be difficult for developers to understand initially, especially when coming from an Object Oriented background.
